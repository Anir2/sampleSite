  "description": "A modern, responsive website was designed and developed for HealingPLUS Health Centre, a wellness clinic specializing in acupuncture, traditional Chinese herbal therapy, and registered massage therapy (RMT). With over 25 years of clinical experience, the clinic needed a clean, calming, and informative online presence to reflect its expertise and holistic approach to health. This project involved close collaboration with clients to translate their values and services into a user-friendly web experience. The site highlights a wide range of health conditions treated, offers detailed information about herbal and massage therapies, and makes it easy for patients to book appointments or learn more.",
